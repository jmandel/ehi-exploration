If your organization documents on the Delivery Summary then after the Delivery Summary is signed, this column is expected to contain the number of viable deliveries associated with the pregnancy. Specifically, this is the number of delivery records attached to the pregnancy. This expectation is based on Epic's recommendation that only viable deliveries should be documented on the Delivery Summary. Your organization may follow a different policy for when to create a delivery record. The behavior of this column containing the number of delivery records may be overridden at the profile level in system definitions, in which case it will continue to contain the number of fetuses that were being carried unless the number of deliveries is manually documented in its place."
