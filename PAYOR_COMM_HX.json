Each row represents a communication that was sent to a payer.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no communication was sent to a specific payer, a row will appear for that payer with the current fax and phone number. In addition, a row will also be displayed for any fax and/or phone number updates, if the update happened after sending the last communication. Therefore, the last row for a given payer contains the most current fax and phone number for them.",
