Unlike ENROLL_LINKED_REPL, this table includes any associated protocols, day numbers, treatment plans, and treatment days with the CSN as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ENROLL_LINKED_CSN view should be used instead of directly linking to this table. The actual data used by this view may be split between the ENROLL_LINKED_REPL or the ENROLL_LINKED_CSN2 tables. The ENROLL_LINKED_CSN view combines the data from both tables regardless of how the underlying data may be shifting between the two tables.",
