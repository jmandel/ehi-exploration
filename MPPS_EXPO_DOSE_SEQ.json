  "description": "This table contains radiation exposure dose sequence data received from Modality Performed Procedure Step (MPPS) or Radiation Dose Structured Reporting (RDSR) messages. Each MPPS message contains radiation exposure information corresponding to one performed procedure step. Each performed procedure step may, however, consist of multiple slices depending on the sophistication of the modality. Each such slice of radiation exposure administered on the patient is recorded as a separate radiation exposure dose sequence in the MPPS message. Similarly one RDSR message may contain radiation exposure information from multiple irradiation events. Each row in this table will correspond to a slice of radiation exposure information from an MPPS message or an irradiation event from an RDSR.",
