  "description": "The REG_WORKFLOW_PROD table contains productivity data about particular workflows on a patient contact such as Admit, Sign-In, Check-In, and Check-Out. This table stores the number of Admit, Sign-In, Check-In and Check-Out workflows completed. The table only tracks a workflow the first time it is successfully completed for that encounter. For example, when a user first checks in a patient to see the doctor, that will be tracked, but if the user subsequently reenters the Check-In workflow and changes some data, that will not be tracked. Similarly, if a user enters the Check-In workflow to try and check in a patient, but then exits the workflow without checking the patient in, that will not be tracked.",
