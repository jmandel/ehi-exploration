  "description": "This table stores the linkages between AP claims (CLM records) and service lines (ETR records) that store adjudication results for cost-sharing reduction (CSR) reconciliation. A common use case for this table is to link from claim-level summary tables to service-line-level summary tables. For example, one path is to join AP_CLAIM to AP_CLAIM_PROC_IDS_CSR on CLAIM_ID and AP_CLAIM_PROC_IDS_CSR to AP_CLAIM_PROC on TX_ID.",
