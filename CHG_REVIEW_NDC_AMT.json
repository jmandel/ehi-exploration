  "description": "This table contains Medical National Drug Code (NDC) administered amount for a temporary accounts receivable (TAR) record that is or has been in a Charge Review workqueue. Because one procedure in a TAR record can be associated with multiple NDC codes, each row in this table represents one NDC administered amount and is identified by the transaction ID (TAR_ID), procedure line number (GROUP_LINE), and line number (VALUE_LINE). The data for this table is extracted using a KB_SQL query. Note: TAR records in Chronicles are purged periodically depending on your system setting. Be aware that old data in this table might be lost if you truncate the table.",
